            <div id="dv1"><p>A soundbar, sound bar or media bar is a type of loudspeaker that projects audio from a wide enclosure. It is much wider than it is tall, partly for acoustic reasons, and partly so it can be mounted above or below a display device, e.g., above a computer monitor or under a home theater or television screen. Basically, in a soundbar multiple speakers are placed in a single cabinet, which helps to create surround sound and/or stereo effect. </p></div>
